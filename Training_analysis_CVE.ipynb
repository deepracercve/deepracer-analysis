    "# Training analysis for DeepRacer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been built based on the `DeepRacer Log Analysis.ipynb` provided by the AWS DeepRacer Team. It has been reorganised and expanded to provide new views on the training data without the helper code which was moved into utility `.py` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "I have expanded this notebook from to present how I'm using this information. It contains descriptions that you may find not that needed after initial reading. Since this file can change in the future, I recommend that you make its copy and reorganize it to your liking. This way you will not lose your changes and you'll be able to add things as you please.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook isn't complete.** What I find interesting in the logs may not be what you will find interesting and useful. I recommend you get familiar with the tools and try hacking around to get the insights that suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, your ideas are very welcome and encouraged so if you have any suggestions either bring them to [the AWS DeepRacer Community](http://join.deepracing.io) or share as code contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on whether you're running your training through the console or using the local setup, and on which setup for local training you're using, your experience will vary. As much as I would like everything to be taylored to your configuration, there may be some problems that you may face. If so, please get in touch through [the AWS DeepRacer Community](http://join.deepracing.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start using the notebook, you will need to install some dependencies. If you haven't yet done so, have a look at [The README.md file](/edit/README.md#running-the-notebooks) to find what you need to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the install, you also have to configure your programmatic access to AWS. Have a look at the guides below, AWS resources will lead you by the hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Boto Configuration: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credits\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to thank [the AWS DeepRacer Community](http://join.deepracing.io) for all the feedback about the notebooks. If you'd like, follow [my blog](https://codelikeamother.uk) where I tend to write about my experiences with AWS DeepRacer.\n",

    "As you have possibly noticed by now, training episodes are grouped into iterations and this notebook also reflects it. What also marks it are checkpoints in the training. After each iteration a set of ckpt files is generated - they contain outcomes of the training, then a model.pb file is built based on that and the car begins a new iteration. Looking at the data grouped by iterations may lead you to a conclusion, that some earlier checkpoint would be a better start for a new training. While this is limited in the AWS DeepRacer Console, with enough disk space you can keep all the checkpoints along the way and use one of them as a start for new training (or even as a submission to a race).\n",

    "While the episodes in a given iteration are a mixture of decision process and random guesses, mean results per iteration may show a specific trend. Mean values are accompanied by standard deviation to show the concentration of values around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rewards per Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see these values as lines or dots per episode in the AWS DeepRacer console. When the reward goes up, this suggests that a car is learning and improving with regards to a given reward function. **This does not have to be a good thing.** If your reward function rewards something that harms performance, your car will learn to drive in a way that will make results worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first the rewards just grow if the progress achieved grows. Interesting things may happen slightly later in the training:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The reward may go flat at some level - it might mean that the car can't get any better. If you think you could still squeeze something better out of it, review the car's progress and consider updating the reward function, the action space, maybe hyperparameters, or perhaps starting over (either from scratch or from some previous checkpoint)\n",
